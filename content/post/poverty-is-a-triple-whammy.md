For more than twenty years, I worked hard. I often worked more than one job at a time. I kept jobs I didn’t like anymore, so that we would have benefits and medical and vacation pay and such. I learned and advanced and built a broad foundation of experience and knowledge.

I worked while my boyfriend  (who then became my husband) started a business, bought out his partner, sold that business, apprenticed in a new field, started a new business, changed partnership configurations a bunch of times, etc…

I was the steady income. A lot of the time, I was the main income. Several times, I was the only income.

In short, I have income earning ability. I have always been capable and willing and darned hard working.

Until life started to fall apart. My kids were increasingly troubled and struggling. My relationship with my husband was increasingly dysfunctional – or at least I recognized the dysfunction more. We tried so hard to figure out solutions and make it better. We went to counselling. We fought. A lot. And the children suffered.

Struggles like that drain you. They take up all your energy. They take away your hope and sense of self efficacy.

Now I find myself mired in a nasty poverty cycle. I struggle, bills go unpaid, I can’t find work, it’s hard to feed the kids, I borrow money to get by. I do better for a bit, but then slide back into the struggle as soon as something goes not quite as planned (and something always goes wrong, doesn’t it?) How did that happen?? part of me asks. How is this possible??

I made choices. I chose to do everything and whatever I could in order to help my kids make it through the crises they were in and grow towards healthy psychological maturity. I chose to be the parent they needed to be, no matter what. I still worked darned hard, but now with a different priority – one that didn’t pay me (as valuable and needed as it was…)

I talked about this journey at TEDxLangleyEd last year (in case you prefer watching/listening): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmgVSdsMu8

When my eldest struggled with school and increasing anxiety and depression, I tried to help in whatever ways I could. Eventually, she stopped attending school and I had no idea what to do. I kept a focus on building healthy attachment, talking, asking questions, and supporting her growth and learning.

Through that whole year, I never knew whether I could go to work safely and leave her. I never knew when my day or night would be hijacked by a panic attack or meltdown. I never had any time alone, since she lived with me full time and would rarely spend time with anyone else.

I tried to continue to work and continued to find it difficult. First of all, how could I commit to projects or even to reliably being available, when I never knew when my day would be entirely consumed or if I would be unable to make it to the office? And second, something I continue to struggle with now is never having time to focus solely on thinking and analyzing and pretty much anything that takes sustained concentration.

During that time, my middle one also began struggling with panic attacks and refusing to go to school. I worked with the teachers, I saw counsellors, I tried forcing him to go, I tried tricking  him into going. And it all felt wrong – betraying the trust I had worked so hard to build was doing nothing to help him feel better about school. Nor would it support his healthy development and mental health. Secure attachment and having a safe place/relationship he could trust to see him/love him/ believe in him/listen to him were critical to healthy psychological maturation. THAT had to be highest priority and my overriding focus.

Just as my eldest decided to return to school after almost a year away, my middle one moved in with me full time and realized he just couldn’t continue to attend his middle school anymore. The youngest one also moved in with my full time at that time, so now I had three kids full time and one at home, refusing to see anyone else or rarely leaving home.

I can’t even express how much energy it took to just get through each day sometimes. My life was a 7×24 therapy session. Between supporting and coaching and taking care of my kids, and working through my own struggles and issues and dysfunctional patterns (so that I could be the parent I needed to be), I felt like there was room for nothing else. Everyday, I had that “hit by a truck” kind of exhaustion.

Finding out I had an autoimmune liver disease (PSC – primary schlerosing cholangitis), whose main effects on me are itchy skin and exhaustion, didn’t help either. If I was still an employee of the Provincial Government (as I was for over ten years), I would have been off on long term disability. Alas, switching to being self employed back then left me on my own with this now.

And there’s where the slide began. Gradually, I used up any savings and cashed in my RRSPs. Next to get used up was any borrowing capacity I might have had. It’s hard to borrow money when you don’t know when or how you’ll pay it back. And anxiety was no longer only a problem my kids struggled with. I stopped answering the phone. I still struggle to even read, let alone respond to emails or letters about money issues. I hate being irresponsible and breaking commitments – it’s not who I am or ever wanted to be.

I burned bridges with work contacts too. I’ve always relied on relationships to get/keep work. But when you let people down (which I did a lot, first because my kids made life too unpredictable, then because I was so anxious), eventually they stop trusting you. And they stop calling you. They certainly stop offering you work. And I stopped trusting myself to make realistic and achievable commitments.

Now I feel like I’ve burned up people’s goodwill too. As much as everyone says you should learn to ask for help when you need it, there’s only so much tolerance for that kind of an ask before people get frustrated or judgmental. The message becomes “what’s the matter with you?” and “why don’t you just get a job?” Believe me, I ask myself that (and more) too. All the time.

I realize now that poverty isn’t just a financial problem – it’s not just money and lack of income that has caused me to get stuck. Poverty is actually a triple whammy. It’s a loss/lack of financial capital of course. But it’s the loss of professional capital and personal capital that has really caused the greatest problems for me! Because those two make getting OUT of poverty exponentially harder. When I was just struggling with too little or no money, I still had resources available to me – family, friends, business contacts. In short, I still had hope. The downturn was just a blip.

But when all three losses of capital hit you, then hope dwindles. And everything gets so much harder!

The slide got really bad when there was no cushion left in my life. Every little step forward was threatened by a big slide back. Any little miscalculation (let alone any big mistakes) are augmented.

And this is where we need more discussion and consideration, if we want to create policy and programs that support struggling families. My situation definitely affects my children and their mental health. My children’s mental health struggles definitely impacted my situation. The social and financial benefit to society for us to get the support needed to move forward successfully, I think, will reap enormous returns – not only to my family, but to the community as a whole, over the long term!

But to be successful, supports need to address all three areas impacted:

1. financial support, so that we have a secure place to live, can pay our bills and can eat;

1. professional support, to find jobs and/or work that fits our skills, time and logistical needs;

1. personal supports, to surround us with community that understands and accepts our needs. As well as medical and therapeutic resources to build healthy relationships, sense of self and ability to manage stress.

What a difference it would make to eradicate poverty, don’t you think? We can do better…
