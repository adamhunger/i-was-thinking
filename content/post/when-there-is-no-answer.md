“You may be over-thinking this,” I said to my eldest.

She had been describing her frustration at some intense emotions/feelings that she just couldn’t make sense of.

Once I clarified that I wasn’t questioning the reality of her feelings – we got to talk about something I’ve noticed about myself and my own anxieties and intense emotions.

Sometimes, there is no reason why. There is no explanation. There is no understanding the “story” behind why we feel some things. You just FEEL…

Feelings happen. They don’t necessarily make sense. And something [Nancy Michel](http://www.denisboyd.com/about-us/therapists/nancy-michel/) ( a local psychologist) once said has always stuck with me about exactly this: "*Feelings are real, but they’re not necessarily true.*"

So, what do you do when emotions and mood swings are intense and threaten to overwhelm? Remind yourself that your feelings are real. And nothing to be ashamed of. And that they won’t last forever.

And then:

**Do what you know you can do.**

1. Move your body. Transform some of that excess emotional energy into physical motion. Walk. Exercise. Go to a yoga class. Whatever way works for you. Motion and big muscle movements help take the "edge" off of those unmanageable emotions.

1. Make some progress on something. Anything! It can be mundane things like doing the dishes or throwing in a load of laundry. It could be making art or building something. It could be sitting down to write, or journal. It could be de-cluttering or cleaning your room. It could be planting something or working in the garden. It could be researching next steps on a project or a job search. It really doesn’t matter much – just DO something. Momentum matters. Get yourself moving in some direction.  You can always change it later!

As a natural analyst and problem solver, I hate not knowing. I want to understand. And it drives me  nuts to not be able to figure something out – particularly something about myself. I want to KNOW the answer.

Gradually, though, I’m learning and practicing. When there is no answer, perhaps this is the only way I can manage to live the questions…

>…have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don’t search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.
