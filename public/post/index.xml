      <description>It has been driving me nuts to not know. To not know how to move forward. To make progress. To make things better. To “fix”…
Amidst much reflection and working on an appreciative inquiry kind of approach (look to what worked previously to find the way forward), I’m realizing something: whenever I’ve faced really tough situations or crises, I’ve felt my way out. I moved by instinct, not really knowing what to do, but simply doing the next thing that FELT right.</description>

Sometimes, there is no reason why.</description>
